    <h1 style="color: #333;">Encapsulation in Java</h1>
    <p style="color: #333;">Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts in Java. It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. The main purpose of encapsulation is to hide the internal state of an object from the outside world and to only allow access through public methods.</p>
    
    <p>Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data within a single unit. This concept restricts direct access to some of the object's components and allows access only through the methods. The main purpose of encapsulation is to ensure that the implementation details of a class are hidden from the user, ensuring a more secure and controlled way of interacting with the object.</p>

    <h2>Key Points:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Hiding</strong>: Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world. It prevents the code and data from being accessed by other code defined outside the class.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Bundling</strong>: It allows the data to be bundled together with the methods that operate on the data. This ensures that the data is always used in a consistent and valid state.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Encapsulation facilitates control over the accessibility of various components of the objects, allowing the class to set the visibility of its attributes and methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: It provides the flexibility to change the implementation of the class without affecting the overall functioning of the code that uses the class.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Maintenance</strong>: Encapsulation simplifies the maintenance of the codebase as changes to the encapsulated code can be localized to the class itself, without affecting other parts of the code that use the class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In Java, encapsulation is typically achieved by declaring the variables of a class as private and providing public getter and setter methods to manipulate those variables. This way, the internal state of the object remains hidden from the outside world, and access to it is controlled through the defined methods.</p>
