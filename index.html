    <h1 style="color: #333;">Introduction to Java</h1>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Java is known for its platform independence, which allows the same code to run on various platforms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform Independence</strong>: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine. This feature has made Java a popular choice for cross-platform development.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong>: Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, which enables developers to create modular programs and reusable code. It supports the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity and Familiarity</strong>: Java was designed to be easy to use and learn, especially for programmers familiar with C and C++. Its syntax is similar to that of C++, making it relatively simple for developers to transition from these languages to Java.</li>
        <li><strong>Robustness</strong>: Java emphasizes early checking for possible errors, which helps in detecting errors early in the development process. It also includes automatic garbage collection, which manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong>: Java places a strong emphasis on security by providing a secure runtime environment. It includes features such as the sandbox security model and automatic memory management to prevent certain types of security threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Multithreading Support</strong>: Java provides built-in support for multithreading, allowing developers to create applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of the software.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich API</strong>: Java comes with an extensive set of class libraries and APIs that provide a wide range of functions for tasks such as networking, I/O, utilities, and database access, among others.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability and Performance</strong>: Java's performance has significantly improved over the years, and it is known for its scalability. With its just-in-time (JIT) compilation, Java can offer performance that is comparable to that of compiled languages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Applications:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enterprise software development</li>
        <li>Web development, including server-side applications and dynamic websites</li>
        <li>Mobile application development, particularly for Android</li>
        <li>Embedded systems and IoT (Internet of Things) devices</li>
        <li>Scientific and research applications</li>
        <li>Big data technologies and cloud computing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Java ecosystem includes a variety of tools and frameworks, such as the Java Development Kit (JDK), Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, and popular frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX. The Java Community Process (JCP) manages and oversees the evolution of the Java language, ensuring that it remains relevant and up-to-date.</p>
